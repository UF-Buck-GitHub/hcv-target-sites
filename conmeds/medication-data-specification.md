# ConMeds Data Specification

Concurrent medications data from an EHR should conform to this specification.  

* All data will be returned in the UTF-8 character set
* The first row of the file will be a header row showing the name of each column, enclosed in double quotes and separated by commas. 
* The field names in the header row are required, but the data they describe is required for REDI to load the data into REDCap. 
* Subsequent rows will show lab result values. All values will be enclosed in double quotes and separated by commas.
* Each row will show one lab result value.  
* Required fields may have blank values if data is missing.
* If your institution does not have RXNORM_CD you may substitute a column with a local unique identifier.

These fields may be specified in the data file:
